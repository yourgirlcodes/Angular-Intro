Syntax:
{{ }} --> js expression / interpolation syntax --> allows us to access data from Model in View

[value] = "data.val" --> angular syntax
(click)="handleClick()"

# ---> gives name of element 
    --> template reference so that we can refer to element
    --> for example, if we want to use the input value in a textbox, 
        don't use e.target.value but rather 
        input.value if the textbox has #input as a ref
